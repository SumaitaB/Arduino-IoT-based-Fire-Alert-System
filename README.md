# Arduino-IoT-based-Fire-Alert-System

Fires are one of the most widespread cause of deaths by accident. Instant alerting to the fire department is necessary to ensure immediate action. Every minute can save many lives in such situations. So here we propose an IOT based automatic fire department alerting system that instantly and automatically alerts the fire department and informs about the situation so that immediate action can be taken. The system efficiently detects fires and alert fire department over IOT. We use an Arduino Uno in order to check if a sensor is triggered.
The Internet of Things (IoT) is essentially a network of 'things' through which with the help of sensors, electronics, software and networking, physical things can exchange data. No human intervention is needed by these systems. We can send LIVE data such as temperature, smoke value detected by a specific device to the Fire Department in this Arduino fire alarm system with temperature and smoke sensor using the IOT project.
Two sensors, namely, temperature and smoke sensors, are used by the IOT Based Fire Alerting System. There is an ADC converter that converts the analog signals received to digital at the end of the sensor and then transmits them to the Arduino microcontroller. When the temperature and the smoke exceed a threshold value, the micro-controller is programmed to turn on the buzzer.

## Applications

A wide variety of systems include a fire alerting system. Arduino's IOT-based fire alarm system can be used in chemical plants, shopping centers, local stores, educational institutions, parking areas, businesses.  
Furthermore, wifi can be used as a precautionary measure at all the locations mentioned above, which can help to alert the fire departments as soon as the buzzer clicks ON. If sufficient and immediate action is taken, it will help to prevent major fire accidents.

The Arduino IoT based fire alert system was successfully developed and tested. The system integrates various sensors, such as smoke detectors and temperature sensors, to detect fire and send alerts to the user. The system is also capable of triggering alarms and activating sprinkler systems to help prevent the spread of fire.
One of the key advantages of the system is its scalability. The modular design allows the addition of new sensors and devices as needed, making it highly customizable to fit the specific requirements of a building. Additionally, the system can be easily integrated with other IoT devices to create a comprehensive smart building solution.
During testing, the system successfully detected simulated fires and sent alerts in real-time. The buzzer was activated as expected, effectively containing the fire and preventing it from spreading. 
Overall, the Arduino IoT based fire alert system offers a highly effective and cost-efficient solution for fire safety in buildings. By leveraging IoT technology this system can help prevent devastating fires. The system's modular design and scalability make it highly adaptable to the specific needs of any building, making it an excellent investment for property owners and that can save lives and prevent property damage.
